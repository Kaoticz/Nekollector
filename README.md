Scroll through images of catgirls one by one in a smooth, modern Java UI. (Yes, we said ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù and ‚ÄúJava‚Äù in the same sentence. Miracles happen.)

### üüä  Favorites

Found the ultimate waifu? Hit that **Favorite** button, and she‚Äôll be saved in the sidebar for easy access.

### üì• Downloads

Like what you see? Download it with a click to cherish it forever (or set as your phone wallpaper, we don‚Äôt judge).

### üé® Responsive Design

Enjoy a responsive UI that doesn‚Äôt explode when you resize the window (unlike most Java apps).
